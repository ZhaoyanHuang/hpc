This is a final project of HPC.

1. file exp.c:Explicit Euler written in pure C language

2. dir      exp_petsc:Explicit format in conjunction with PETSC and hdf5
   file   exp_petsc.c:Explicit format in conjunction with PETSC and hdf5
   file      MakeFile:compiling script
   file exp_petsc.out:Executable file
   file        script:Submit jobs to taiyi

 first run: "make exp_petsc.out", then run: "bsub<script"
 Using "-n" and "-dt" in the script to change the grid and time resolution
 The result data store in "exp_heat.h5"
